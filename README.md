# KotlinForJavaDevelopersGrader

This is real grader that is currently being used for [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers) Coursera course by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

So as not to expose hidden tests and other content from the real course, a task from [Kotlin Koans workshop](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans) is used as an example programming assignment.

The key feature of this grader is compatibility with [EduTools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) plugin: learners can submit their programming assignments directly from IDE.

To learn more about how it looks for learners check our [guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/coursera-programming-assignments.html)

The current version of grader supports only Kotlin, but it can be adapted to support any of the languages EduTools plugin supports (Java, Kotlin, Python, Scala, JavaScript, Rust).

If you have any feature request or bug reports, please create an issue in our [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/edu)

If you want to use this grader in your Coursera course and need help, please [contact us](mailto:academy@jetbrains.com)
